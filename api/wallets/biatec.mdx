description: Deprecated convenience wrapper for WalletConnect with Biatec branding
---

<Warning>
**Deprecated**: `BiatecWallet` is deprecated and will be removed in v5. Use `WalletConnect` with the `'biatec'` skin instead.
</Warning>

## Overview

`BiatecWallet` is a deprecated convenience class that extends `WalletConnect` with Biatec branding. It provides the same functionality as WalletConnect but with pre-configured Biatec-specific metadata.

## Migration

Instead of using `BiatecWallet`, use the `WalletConnect` provider with the `'biatec'` skin:

```typescript
// Old (deprecated)
import { WalletId } from '@txnlab/use-wallet'

const walletManager = new WalletManager({
  wallets: [WalletId.BIATEC]
})
```

```typescript
// New (recommended)
import { WalletId } from '@txnlab/use-wallet'

const walletManager = new WalletManager({
  wallets: [
    {
      id: WalletId.WALLETCONNECT,
      options: {
        projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
        skin: 'biatec'
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

## Why Deprecated?

The separate `BiatecWallet` class was created before the skin system was implemented in WalletConnect. Now that WalletConnect supports customizable skins, maintaining a separate class for each WalletConnect-based wallet is redundant.

The skin system provides the same functionality while:
- Reducing code duplication
- Making it easier to add new WalletConnect-based wallets
- Providing a consistent API across all WalletConnect variants

## Class Definition

```typescript
export class BiatecWallet extends WalletConnect {
  constructor(args: WalletConstructor<WalletId.BIATEC>)
  
  static defaultMetadata: {
    name: 'BiatecWallet'
    icon: string // SVG data URI
  }
}
```
